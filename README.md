Welcome to the Otago Polytechnic Software Engineering repo. This repository contains the base files, database schemas, and notes for your project.

## Basic things you should know:

- This is a Java web application
- It uses an application framework called Spring - https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/
- It is configured for a PostgreSQL database - https://www.postgresql.org/
- It uses a framework for database manipulation called Hibernate - http://hibernate.org/
- It uses a template engine called Freemarker - http://freemarker.org/

You don't have to know the ins and outs of all these bits and pieces, but you should understand the basics of what these frameworks are used for. Read up a little bit on the sites listed above and, most importantly, look through the existing code to get a feel for what is going on.

NOTE: If you are trying to load this project in Eclipse, do not IMPORT the project once you've cloned it, but go to FILE > NEW JAVA APPLICATION > and unclick the default path option and instead point to the cloned project code folder. Don't ask me why...

If you have errors after doing this, run Project > Clean to update the Maven dependencies... don't know what Maven is? Look it up!
