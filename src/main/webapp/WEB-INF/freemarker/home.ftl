		The Freeza Pizzas journey began in 1977, in New York. Two Italian immigrants, Mr. Cacciatore and Mama Leone, opened an Italian restaurant called &apos;Vienna&apos; on Sullivan Street, 
		serving the locals hot, fresh pizza like they made in the old country.
		Vienna proved overwhelmingly popular with New Yorkers, however, the fast-paced restaurant proved too much for poor Mr. Cacciatore, who suffered a heart attack and died young.  
		 Not wanting to carry on without her husband, Mama Leone ended up leaving the business to their son, Anthony 
		(as the story goes, Mama Leone left a note on his door, simply reading &quot;Moved out to the country&quot;).<br>
		<br> 		
		Vienna continued to grow in popularity for several years, until finally it was sued by songwriter Billy Joel for infringing on so many of his songs. Vienna was forced to close its doors in 2008. 
		Undeterred, Anthony opened a new company, &apos;Freeza Pizzas&apos;, supplying frozen versions of his parents&apos; signature pizzas to supermarkets and restaurants. 
		<br><br> Anthony (along with his wife Virginia) now sell direct to customers, both online and from their factory store. 
		<br><br> 
		Anthony and Virginia invite you to try one of their irresistible pizzas today (with a bottle of red or a bottle of white, it all depends on your appetite!)<br>
